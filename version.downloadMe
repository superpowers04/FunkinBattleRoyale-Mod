* A bunch of fixes
* Clean up results screen
* Include tutorial and the first week as examples. Complete with custom charts for all 4 songs :3
* The game now actually autosaves the chart in the chart editor
* Ditch FlxG.save.data, it's a dynamic variable which is slower and cring. Sadly this change will make you lose your settings
* Make scrollbar work like other scrollbars(If you hold click, it'll scroll until you let go even if you're not hovering over it)
