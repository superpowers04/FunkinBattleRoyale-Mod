# Super Engine Stable
**Please note, this isn't the latest version of the mod, the mod's latest unstable updates can be found on the [actions page](https://github.com/superpowers04/Super-Engine/actions), [the unstabe branch](https://github.com/superpowers04/Super-Engine/tree/nightly), [at nightly.link](https://nightly.link/superpowers04/Super-Engine/workflows/main/nightly) or on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/28GPGTRuuR). If you want a stable engine, 0.10.0 is more stable however 0.10.0 is less polished and has far less features**

This is a mod of [Funkin Battle Royale](https://github.com/XieneDev/FunkinBattleRoyale/)<br>
This is powered by a modded version of [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine) with a hint of [FPSPlus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public/) added in and with some inspiration from [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)/[FNF Multi](https://shadowmario.itch.io/funkinmulti) <br>
I do not own Friday Night Funkin, Kade Engine or Funkin Battle Royale, I'd highly recommend checking them out.
This is client aims to allow people to use normal Funkin Battle Royale servers with custom characters or play custom charts and such when offline<br>
